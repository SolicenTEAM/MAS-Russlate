=

=

=

=

= 

# "There's no need to trouble yourself."
= 

# "I'd be happy to go with him."
= 

# "Aw, but I wanted to go!"
= 

# "It's so much fun exploring empty classrooms and stuff!"
= 

# "Hehe, okay, okay."
= 

# "It was just a suggestion."
= 

# "See if you can find poster paper too, okay?"
= 

# "Okaay~!"
= 

# "Ready, [player]?"
= 

# "Yep, let's go."
= 

# "Sayori and I exit the clubroom."
= 

# "I follow behind as Sayori hums and skips around the hallway."
= 

# "Honestly..."
= 

# "It feels like I'm taking a kid to the mall or something."
= 

# "Sayori finds pleasure in the simplest things sometimes."
= 

# "Hey, Sayori..."
= 

# "What exactly are we doing for the festival, anyway?"
= 

# "I'm not sure how you would make an event out of literature..."
= 

# "Ehehe!"
= 

# "Me and Monika have it all planned out!"
= 

# "Don't you worry~"
= 

# "Is that so...?"
=

=

= 

# "A performance...?"
= 

# "Of what kind?"
= 

# "Well..."
= 

# "Everyone is gonna take turns on stage..."
= 

# "And recite their favorite poems!"
= 

# "Ah..."
= 

# "That sounds..."
= 

# "...Kind of dull?"
= 

# "You're not thinking about it the right way at all!"
= 

# "It's not just about reading poems..."
= 

# "It's about performing them!"
= 

# "Like, you say the lines of the poem like..."
= 

# "{i}Between my feet...{/i}"
= 

# "{i}The last remaining flower beckons to me.{/i}"
=

=

=

=

= 

# "{i}The once-prosperous field before me...{/i}"
= 

# "{i}Is but a barren wasteland!{/i}"
= 

# "..."
= 

# "Like that!!"
= 

# "Sayori..."
= 

# "How do I put this..."
= 

# "I'm sure it's just me, but it's impossible for me to take you seriously when you talk like that..."
= 

# "Ehhh?"
= 

# "You meanie!"
= 

# "I'm working super hard on this, you know!"
= 

# "Ah, I know, I know!"
= 

# "I just meant that it's a pretty unordinary contrast to your cute self."
= 

# "Ahaha! Don't say that, it's embarrassing!"
=

= 

# "Yeah, I guess so..."
=

= 

# "The festival is going to be so much fun~"
= 

# "Sayori spins herself around in the hallway again."
= 

# "Hey, [player], this classroom over here is empty!"
= 

# "Let's begin the mission!"
= 

# "The mission, eh...?"
= 

# "It's been a long time since I've spent time with Sayori like this."
= 

# "But in the end, she hasn't changed one bit."
= 

# "She's nothing but a ball of sunshine, drawing happy vibes from the world around her."
= 

# "It's a pretty nostalgic feeling for me."
= 

# "As the years went by, I began to hole myself up in my room more and more."
= 

# "So going adventuring with Sayori brings about a special sort of feeling I forgot I had in me."
= 

# "The two of us enter the classroom."
= 

# "Sayori heads straight to the closet, and I follow."
= 

# "Let's see what we have in here..."
= 

# "...Crayons!!"
= 

# "Sayori pulls a box full of crayons off the shelf."
= 

# "They're the best brand, too!"
= 

# "They're kind of dirty, though..."
= 

# "Sayori starts pulling various crayons out of the box, reading the color names."
= 

# "Alright, that's one down."
= 

# "Don't get distracted, we still need to find--"
= 

# "Wait, I'm looking for my favorite color..."
= 

# "Fine, fine..."
= 

# "Then at least move aside so I can look for the poster paper."
= 

# "Ah, I dropped one by accident--"
= 

# "{i}Smack!{/i}"
= 

# "Kya--!"
= 

# "Sayori bends over and smacks her forehead right into the shelf."
= 

# "She falls to the floor, and the crayons spill all over her lap."
= 

# "Owowowowow..."
= 

# "You okay?"
= 

# "My forehead..."
= 

# "Sayori clutches her forehead."
= 

# "Jeez, Sayori..."
= 

# "That's just like you, isn't it?"
= 

# "C'mon, let me see."
= 

# "Since Sayori is sitting on the floor, I grab her by the waist and pull her out of the closet."
= 

# "You have to move your hands, Sayori..."
= 

# "But it hurts..."
= 

# "Just do it for a second."
= 

# "Sayori slowly releases her hands from her forehead."
= 

# "I gently brush her bangs to the side."
= 

# "Ow--!"
= 

# "Sorry..."
= 

# "There's a huge red mark on the center of her forehead."
= 

# "A bump is starting to form, as well."
= 

# "Man, that's gonna swell up."
= 

# "I should find you some ice..."
= 

# "[player]..."
= 

# "Where would I even find ice around this time...?"
= 

# "Ah, I guess a cold drink would do..."
= 

# "You don't have to--!"
= 

# "I'm fine with--looking like a unicorn--"
= 

# "Even wincing from the pain, Sayori makes a silly joke."
= 

# "Ahaha, what are you saying?"
= 

# "I'll be right back, okay?"
= 

# "O-Okay..."
= 

# "I pat Sayori on the shoulder and run out into the hallway."
= 

# "I locate the nearest vending machine."
= 

# "What should I get...?"
= 

# "It doesn't really matter, since it will be used as an ice pack, rather than to drink."
= 

# "But I know Sayori likes apple juice, so I purchase that one."
= 

# "In just a moment, I'm already returning to the classroom where I left Sayori."
= 

# "She has one palm on her forehead and is using the other hand to clumsily scoop crayons back into the box."
= 

# "At least they were already in the wrong spots before I spilled them..."
= 

# "Sayori, here."
= 

# "I hand Sayori the bottle of apple juice."
= 

# "It's nice and cold..."
= 

# "Sayori opens the cap and starts drinking from it."
= 

# "Sayori, what are you doing?!"
= 

# "It's for your forehead, idiot!"
= 

# "Ah--"
= 

# "Sorry, I forgot~"
= 

# "Ahahaha!"
= 

# "How hard did you hit your head...?"
= 

# "Sayori places the bottle against the bump on her head."
= 

# "It stings..."
= 

# "Just bear with it, it'll feel better soon."
= 

# "Looks like you cleaned up most of the crayons, so that's good."
= 

# "Hey, [player]..."
= 

# "This kind of reminds you of growing up, doesn't it...?"
= 

# "Eh? What do you mean?"
= 

# "You know how we used to play outside all the time..."
= 

# "I would always try to keep up with you."
= 

# "You were kind of oblivious in some ways..."
= 

# "Like I usually fell behind or had trouble climbing on the things you did..."
= 

# "But sometimes when I tried to do things I couldn't, I would get myself hurt."
= 

# "I'd fall and scrape myself, or get a bump..."
= 

# "And I would start crying really hard."
= 

# "Ahaha!"
= 

# "And you would rush over as quick as you could."
= 

# "You would try really hard to get me to stop crying."
= 

# "It was almost like you blamed yourself and were afraid of getting in trouble if someone found out..."
= 

# "Even though it really wasn't your fault at all, you know?"
= 

# "Did I really do that...?"
= 

# "Yeah...you don't remember?"
= 

# "Come to think of it, maybe I do remember a bit..."
= 

# "I guess I was always so focused on my games that I didn't pay enough attention to you."
= 

# "So in a way, it was my fault."
= 

# "Kind of like this time, too..."
= 

# "If I wasn't rushing you out of the closet, you probably wouldn't have hit your head."
= 

# "[player]..."
= 

# "I don't think you realize it, but you're always thinking about other people."
= 

# "Even after all these years..."
= 

# "You're rushing to help me, even though I'm just being clumsy."
= 

# "You're really a sweetheart..."
= 

# "D-Don't call me that!"
= 

# "And I don't really do this kind of thing all the time..."
= 

# "I guess when it comes to you, it just feels natural."
= 

# "Before I even know it, I'm treating you like that."
= 

# "I guess that's what happens when you've been friends for so long."
= 

# "Really...?"
= 

# "Maybe you're right..."
= 

# "[player]..."
= 

# "I'm so glad that nothing's changed between us."
= 

# "Do you think it'll be like this forever?"
= 

# "Forever...?"
= 

# "If I'm honest to myself..."
= 

# "There's no telling where we'll each end up for college, or after that."
= 

# "So it wouldn't be fair for me to make any promises."
= 

# "But..."
= 

# "Well, I hope so."
= 

# "It's been this long already, right?"
= 

# "I can't imagine you ever changing, so my hopes are up."
= 

# "I'm so happy..."
= 

# "Sayori has a whimsical expression in her eyes."
= 

# "We remain silent for a moment."
= 

# "She's so silly and clumsy on the outside that when I see her deep in thought like this..."
= 

# "It makes me not want to disturb her."
= 

# "I guess we should go back..."
= 

# "I don't want to worry Monika, you know?"
= 

# "Good luck with that."
= 

# "She's gonna see your forehead either way."
= 

# "Not if I hide it under my bangs~"
=

= 

# "A-Aaahh--!"
=

=

= 

# "Uuuu..."
= 

# "Well, I guess it's too late now..."
= 

# "Anyway, let's go."
=
