=

= 

# "I feel that the heart of writing isn't about getting it right first time, but about perfecting it afterwards." 
= 

# "The end product is what matters, not the prototype." 
=

= 

# "I think it's like that with all things, not just writing." 
= 

# "Anything that needs you to try and try again, whether it be art, music, learning, or even relationships."

= 

# "It may end up badly, but if you don't try, you won't know how it'll end up." 
= 

# "And if things go well, you might end up finding something you like!" 
=

= 

# "I'd say it helps particularly if you're stuck in a situation you want to solve, but don't know how."
