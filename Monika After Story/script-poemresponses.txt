=

=

=

=

= 

# "I doubt I have to explain it."
=

=

=

= 

# "Do you know people like that?"
= 

# "Of course. It's about how everyone thinks my--"
= 

# "...That doesn't matter! It can be about anything!"
=

= 

# "Everyone has some kind of weird hobby, or a guilty pleasure."
=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

= 

# "It's what I do best, after all!"
= 

# "I don't like writing unless there's a good message to take away from it."
=

=

= 

# "Remember that!"
= 

# "I'm gonna write a good one for tomorrow, too, so look forward to it."
= 

# "Yeah..."
= 

# "I felt like I kept writing about negative things, so I wanted to write something with a nice message for once."
= 

# "Besides...the beach is awesome!"
=

= 

# "So you decided to write about the beach first, and then came up with the message later?"
= 

# "Yeah, well..."
= 

# "It's only because of what happened yesterday."
= 

# "I mean, after Yuri and I realized we kind of wrote about the same thing..."
= 

# "She wanted to pick a topic and have us both write about it, or whatever."
= 

# "I see..."
=

= 

# "I see..."
=

=

=

= 

# "Well, that's--"
=

= 

# "After all, she was the one who wanted us to write about the same topic."
=

= 

# "Making us write about a simple topic, then trying to impress me by coming up with something all fancy."
= 

# "Well, it's not like I care."
= 

# "I just did it anyway."
= 

# "I mean, I guess mine ended up being kind of metaphorical too..."
=

=

= 

# "..."
= 

# "...Why are you looking at me like that?"
= 

# "If you don't like it, then just say it."
= 

# "I won't...get mad."
= 

# "No, it's not that I don't like it...!"
=

=

=

=

# "Maybe she's not an expert..."
= 

# "But you probably won't find much filler in her poems."
= 

# "They might be easy to write, but they're super challenging to get the meaning through."
= 

# "So I can see why it would be your kind of poem to explore!"
= 

# "I like this one!"
= 

# "It makes me think of something Sayori would like."
= 

# "Is that so?"
= 

# "You and Sayori are really good friends, right?"
= 

# "I wouldn't be surprised if you had those sorts of things in common."
= 

# "Ah, well..."
= 

# "We may be good friends, but Sayori and I are actually really different."
= 

# "Hmm..."
= 

# "Well, that may be the case."
= 

# "But maybe there are also some similarities that you wouldn't expect."
= 

# "The way she talks about you..."
= 

# "It sounds like the two of you really care about each other's well-being."
= 

# "Even if you show it in different ways, it ends up being more similar than you'd think."
= 

# "So I think that's the kind of vibe I get when reading your poem."
= 

# "Hmm..."
= 

# "You sure you're not reading into it too much?"
= 

# "Ahaha! I could be!"
= 

# "Oh gosh, I sound like Yuri..."
= 

# "...But in any case, Sayori's writing has kind of a gentle feel to it."
= 

# "I can tell that she likes exploring with emotions, like happiness and sadness."
= 

# "Who knew that someone so happy would enjoy sad things, too?"
= 

# "Yeah... That's totally unexpected."
= 

# "Well, to each their own~"
= 

# "And you shouldn't be afraid to experiment a little bit, either."
= 

# "Great job, [player]!"
= 

# "I was going 'Ooh' in my head while reading it."
= 

# "It's really metaphorical!"
= 

# "I'm not sure why, but I didn't expect you to go for something so deep."
= 

# "I guess I underestimated you!"
= 

# "It's easiest for me to keep everyone's expectations low."
= 

# "That way, it always counts when I put in some effort."
= 

# "Ahaha! That's not very fair!"
= 

# "Well, I guess it worked, anyway."
= 

# "You know that Yuri likes this kind of writing, right?"
= 

# "Writing that's full of imagery and symbolism."
= 

# "Unlike Sayori, who likes using simple and direct words to describe happiness and sadness..."
= 

# "Yuri likes it when readers are left to derive their own meaning out of it."
= 

# "It's very challenging to write like that effectively."
= 

# "Both allowing people to get something out of it just by feel..."
= 

# "Or letting them deeply analyze all of the nuances."
= 

# "It can take years of practice, which I'm assuming Yuri has at this point."
= 

# "I never really asked, though..."
= 

# "I'm sure I'm nowhere near her level yet."
= 

# "Don't worry so much about that!"
= 

# "You do your own thing."
= 

# "Just keep exploring, and learn by trying new things!"
= 

# "It's pretty good~"
= 

# "You've been spending some time with Natsuki, haven't you?"
= 

# "You must like her writing style."
= 

# "Ah, yeah..."
= 

# "I think it's a neat way to tell a story."
= 

# "Mhm. I don't disagree."
= 

# "Natsuki's poems may be cute, but they're also meaningful."
= 

# "I can see why you'd be into the style."
= 

# "I guess that means you're not as much a fan of Yuri's poems, then?"
= 

# "Ah-- I wouldn't say that..."
= 

# "I kind of like everyone's poems."
= 

# "That's true, but I'm sure you like some more than others, right?"
= 

# "Like Yuri's use of complex words and symbolism..."
= 

# "Or Sayori's way of expressing happiness or sadness in a more direct way."
= 

# "You must have some kind of preference, don't you?"
= 

# "Ah, not that it's a contest or anything!"
= 

# "I was just curious, that's all."
= 

# "It's pretty good~"
= 

# "It makes me think of Sayori, like the other one that you wrote."
= 

# "You two are like the dynamic duo!"
= 

# "Ahaha... That's kind of exaggerating it."
= 

# "Yeah, probably."
= 

# "But you do spend a lot of time with her even in this club, don't you?"
= 

# "Then again, I don't blame you for being a little shy~"
= 

# "I-I'm not shy, it's just..."
= 

# "Ahaha! I'm just teasing."
= 

# "I know it takes a bit of time to make friends with everyone."
= 

# "But Yuri and Natsuki are super interesting people, so don't be afraid to give them their share of time!"
= 

# "And you can talk to me every now and then too..."
= 

# "I'm not, like, unapproachable or anything, am I?"
= 

# "Ah, no, it's nothing like that..."
= 

# "I'm just still getting used to being here, that's all."
= 

# "Yeah..."
= 

# "I'm sorry if I was putting pressure on you or something!"
= 

# "I really didn't mean it like that."
= 

# "No, don't worry."
= 

# "I get what you're saying."
= 

# "Well, alright~"
= 

# "This one's good!"
= 

# "It feels like you're not only getting more comfortable with your style..."
= 

# "But the imagery is better than the last one I read!"
= 

# "Just wondering, but have you been finding inspiration in Yuri's writing style?"
= 

# "Hmm..."
= 

# "I guess so."
= 

# "You can't deny that she's talented."
= 

# "Yeah, totally!"
= 

# "I think her poems are the most..."
= 

# "...Romantic."
= 

# "That's the best way to describe it."
= 

# "She's like a totally different person when she picks up a pen..."
= 

# "I noticed that, too."
= 

# "Or when she's talking about literature, it's like a light turns on inside her."
= 

# "Mhm!"
= 

# "Sadly, it's hard to get much personal conversation out of her..."
= 

# "Trust me, I've tried..."
= 

# "Who knows what goes on in that head of hers?"
= 

# "I hope you don't mean that in a bad way."
= 

# "No, of course not!"
= 

# "I just meant that I wish she didn't keep so much to herself..."
= 

# "But still, defending her like that..."
= 

# "You must be pretty into her..."
= 

# "Eh?!"
= 

# "You...completely misunderstood!"
= 

# "Ahaha! Calm down, I'm kidding!"
= 

# "Besides, I'm pretty sure she's already got a boyfriend..."
= 

# "Wait, really?"
= 

# "Yeah. A fictional one, anyway."
= 

# "Monika kind of whispers that last part to me."
= 

# "It's just a hunch, but..."
= 

# "...Well, there's not really anything wrong with that!"
= 

# "Oh, well I know...!"
= 

# "I was just saying~"
= 

# "Sticking with the Natsuki style once more, I see~"
= 

# "Hmm..."
= 

# "You really like Natsuki, don't you?"
= 

# "Eh? That's--"
= 

# "Oh, come on, [player]."
= 

# "It's awfully suspicious, you know?"
= 

# "Spending time with her in the clubroom every day..."
= 

# "Pretending to like the manga that she's into..."
= 

# "Y-You know how Natsuki is...!"
= 

# "If I don't indulge her, she'll end up hating me."
= 

# "Eh?"
= 

# "No, I think you're misunderstanding, [player]."
= 

# "It's not like Natsuki just hates anyone who doesn't give her what she wants."
= 

# "Yeah, she's assertive, but she's not that selfish..."
= 

# "In fact, I think you're the only one who's indulged her as much as you have."
= 

# "Is that so..."
= 

# "I kind of knew that, but I just didn't want to admit it."
= 

# "So, I just need to ask one thing of you..."
= 

# "...Be careful. Please?"
= 

# "Natsuki is kind of unpredictable."
= 

# "A lot of times, she doesn't even know what she wants."
= 

# "After all, she's the youngest one here."
= 

# "She might not know how to handle her own feelings properly."
= 

# "What I'm saying is..."
= 

# "If something bad happens, then it could end up damaging the club, too..."
= 

# "And you wouldn't do that to me...right?"
= 

# "That's--"
= 

# "I'm not sure how to respond to Monika."
= 

# "While I care about her and the club, it's also kind of unfair to bring that up."
= 

# "Well...you're smart."
= 

# "I'm sure you'll do the right thing."
= 

# "Monika smiles sweetly."
= 

# "Ahaha."
= 

# "It's kind of funny..."
= 

# "How so?"
= 

# "No, not the poem..."
= 

# "I mean, it's funny how your poems and Sayori's poems have been getting more and more similar to each other every day."
= 

# "I'm surprised you're so in sync with her."
= 

# "Then again, you've been spending a lot of time together lately, haven't you?"
= 

# "Ah, I guess you could say that..."
= 

# "Although we kind of grew up as best friends, I haven't been seeing as much of her this past year..."
= 

# "But since I joined the club, we've been spending a lot of time together again."
= 

# "I see, I see~"
= 

# "That reminds me..."
= 

# "About how Sayori's been a little bit off today..."
= 

# "Yeah? Did she tell you something?"
= 

# "Ah..."
= 

# "Well..."
= 

# "O-Of course not!"
= 

# "I've been treating her like I always do."
= 

# "Alright."
= 

# "Just making sure~"
= 

# "I know how much you care about her..."
= 

# "It would be terrible if something bad happened to her, so keep an eye on her."
= 

# "Sayori's been acting so much happier ever since you joined the club."
= 

# "What could have happened all of a sudden...?"
= 

# "..."
= 

# "...Well, never mind."
= 

# "This really isn't the time to be talking about this..."
= 

# "Your style's gotten so refined, [player]."
= 

# "Yuri's been teaching you a lot of things, hasn't she?"
= 

# "Well--"
= 

# "I guess so."
= 

# "Yeah... I've been noticing how much time you spend with her."
= 

# "I think I've heard her say more words these past couple days than she's talked in the whole year."
= 

# "Not sure how you did it, but that's pretty impressive..."
= 

# "Well, she just needs some patience and a way to talk about all the things in her head, I guess..."
= 

# "I'm still getting the hang of it, myself."
= 

# "Hm..."
= 

# "You're certainly putting in a lot of effort."
= 

# "You must really like her."
= 

# "Eh? That's--"
= 

# "Ahaha!"
= 

# "It's awfully suspicious, you know?"
= 

# "Spending time with her in the clubroom every day..."
= 

# "Reading that edgy novel with her..."
= 

# "Well--!"
= 

# "I just...feel bad that she has a hard time socializing."
= 

# "It makes me want to make sure she doesn't spend all her time alone."
= 

# "Besides, the novel isn't too bad either, you know..."
= 

# "Alright, alright~"
= 

# "I get you."
= 

# "Just...be careful, alright?"
= 

# "I know that Yuri isn't used to opening herself up..."
= 

# "So if something bad happens while she's vulnerable..."
= 

# "Then it could be really hard for her."
= 

# "Her books aren't a total escape from reality."
= 

# "They're just a bandage."
= 

# "You say that like I'm going to hurt her..."
= 

# "Sorry, I didn't really mean that~"
= 

# "If anything, she might accidentally hurt herself."
=
