# "Clauses"

=

= 

# "An example of one could be '{b}who saved her.{/b}'"

= 

# "This doesn't seem like a problem at first, but you could imagine adding more and more clauses to that sentence..." 
= 

# "The result would be a mess!" 
= 

# "The best way to avoid this mistake is to separate independent clauses with periods, conjunctions, or semicolons." 
= 

# "A conjunction is basically a word that you use to connect two clauses or phrases together." 
= 

# "They're a pretty interesting topic on their own, so we can go over them in a future tip!" 
=

# "That's all I have for today, [player]."

# "Thanks for listening!" 
= 

# "Conjunctions"

= 

# "Just imagine speaking without conjunctions..." 
= 

# "As you will see, conjunctions are great for combining ideas, and at the same time, they make your writing sound fluid and more similar to how we actually talk."

# "Now, let's revisit our earlier example, this time with conjunctions..." 
= 

# "'{b}It would be dull, and you would sound choppy. Since these ideas all relate, we should connect them.{/b}'"

# "Much better, don't you think?" 
= 

# "Their names may sound a little daunting, but I promise they'll make more sense as we go through them. I'll give you examples as we go along." 
= 

# "Coordinating clauses bridge two words, phrases, or clauses of the same 'rank' together. This just means that they have to be of the same type...words with words, or clauses with clauses." 
= 

# "You can connect independent clauses, {i}and{/i} you can avoid comma splices!" 
= 

# "Correlative conjunctions are pairs of conjunctions used to connect ideas." 
= 

# "{i}Whether{/i} you realize it {i}or{/i} not, we use them all the time...like in this sentence!"
= 

# "Lastly, subordinating conjunctions bring together independent and dependent clauses." 
= 

# "As you can imagine, there are many ways we can do that!" 
= 

# "{i}Since{/i} there are so many, this category of conjunctions is the widest!"
=

= 

# "'{i}...a place where you can expect to sit for a moment, catching your breath.{/i}'"
= 

# "I really appreciate how eloquently he describes something as simple as a punctuation mark!" 
= 

# "Some people think you can use a semicolon as a substitute for a colon, while others treat it as a period..." 
= 

# "If you recall our talk on clauses, the semicolon is actually meant to connect two independent clauses." 
= 

# "For example, if I wanted to keep two ideas together, such as '{b}You're here{/b}' and '{b}I'm happy{/b},' I could write them as..." 
= 

# "'{b}You're here; I'm happy{/b}' instead of '{b}You're here, and I'm happy{/b}' or '{b}You're here. I'm happy{/b}.'"
= 

# "All three sentences convey the same message, but in comparison, '{b}You're here; I'm happy{/b}' connects the two clauses at a happy medium." 
= 

# "In the end, this always depends on the ideas you want to connect, but I think that Thomas puts it well when you compare them to periods or commas." 
= 

# "Unlike a period, which opens up to a completely different sentence, or a comma, which shows you there is more to come in the same one..." 
= 

# "A semicolon really is that in-between, or, as Thomas says, '{i}a place where you can expect to sit for a moment and catch your breath.{/i}'" 
= 

# "At least this gives you a whole other option; hopefully, you can now make better use of the semicolon when you're writing..."

= 

# "Remember when I told you about clauses having an action and a verb?" 
= 

# "The object is the person or thing that the subject acts on!" 
= 

# "Oh, it's important to note that objects aren't necessary to form complete sentences..." 
= 

# "The sentence could very well have been, '{b}We watched.{/b}'" 
= 

# "That's a complete sentence...although it's an ambiguous one, ahaha!" 
= 

# "There's also nothing that says that the object has to come last, but I'll discuss that in more detail another time." 
= 

# "Just remember that the subject is doing the action and the object is acted upon."

# "Active and Passive Voices" 
= 

# "There's the active voice and the passive voice."

= 

# "Let's say the subject is '{b}Sayori{/b}' and the object is a '{b}cupcake{/b}.'" 
= 

# "As you can see, you can use the passive voice to be secretive about the subject yet still have a complete sentence." 
= 

# "For example, in some careers, people have to use the passive voice to be impersonal." 
= 

# "Scientists describe experiments with '{b}the results were documented{/b}...' since the important part is their work and not who did it." 
= 

# "Anyway, for the most part, stick with the active voice for readability and, you know, to directly tell who's doing what."

= 

# "Who vs. Whom" 
= 

# "Today we will talk about the uses of '{b}who{/b}' and '{b}whom{/b}.'" 
= 

# "Most of the time, it seems like people just use '{b}who{/b}' without bothering to learn the difference, ahaha." 
= 

# "The difference is that '{b}who{/b}' refers to a subject, and '{b}whom{/b}' refers to an object." 
= 

# "It turns out that it's pretty easy to figure out when to use one or the other!" 
= 

# "'{b}Who{/b}' corresponds to '{b}he{/b}/{b}she{/b}/{b}they{/b}' while '{b}whom{/b}' corresponds to '{b}him{/b}/{b}her{/b}/{b}them{/b}.'"
= 

# "Simply replace the possible '{b}who{/b}' or '{b}whom{/b}' with '{b}he{/b}/{b}she{/b}/{b}they{/b}' or '{b}him{/b}/{b}her{/b}/{b}them{/b}.'" 
= 

# "Only one replacement should make sense, and that should tell you which one to use!" 
=

= 

# "'{b}She knows everything{/b}' or '{b}her knows everything{/b}.'"

= 

# "That's all I have for today, [player]."

# "Thanks for listening!"

# "And I vs. And me" 
= 

# "Last time, we talked about the difference between '{b}who{/b}' and '{b}whom{/b}.'"

# "Is it '{b}[player] and I went on a date{/b}' or '{b}[player] and me went on a date{/b}?'" 
= 

# "Just like with '{b}who{/b}' and '{b}whom{/b},' the issue boils down to one of subjects and objects."

= 

# "Conversely, if the speaker is the object of the sentence, '{b}and me{/b}' is correct." 
= 

# "Luckily, just like when we talked about '{b}who{/b}' versus '{b}whom{/b},' it turns out there's a simple way to figure out which one is correct!" 
= 

# "In our example, if you just take out '{b}[player] and{/b}' from the sentence, only one should make sense." 
= 

# "Let's try it out!" 
= 

# "Clearly, only the first one makes sense, so it's '{b}[player] and I went on a date{/b}.'" 
= 

# "Ahaha! Don't worry, I'd never leave you behind." 
= 

# "Now, on the other hand, if I was the object of the sentence, I would need to use '{b}and me{/b}' instead."

# "Apostrophes"

= 

# "Add them to show possession: '{b}Sayori’s fork, Natsuki’s spoon, Yuri’s knife{/b}...'"
= 

# "I guess the issue that can come up is when you have to add an apostrophe to a word that ends with an '{b}s{/b}.'" 
= 

# "It's pretty clear that '{b}monkey’s{/b},' which would indicate possession belonging to a single monkey, or '{b}monkeys’s{/b}' would be wrong." 
= 

# "The gray area that comes up is when we bring in people's names, like '{b}Sanders{/b}' or '{b}[tempname]{/b}.'" 
= 

# "In some style guides I've read, it seems that we usually add an apostrophe and '{b}s{/b}' as usual, with the exception of historical names like '{b}Sophocles{/b}' or '{b}Zeus{/b}.'" 
= 

# "Personally, I think all that matters here is consistency!" 
= 

# "If you're going to go with '{b}[tempname]’{/b},' then it's fine as long as you use '{b}[tempname]’{/b}' for the entire text." 
= 

# "That matters more than honoring some old Greeks to me." 
= 

# "One interesting exception is the case of '{b}its{/b}' versus '{b}it’s{/b}.'" 
= 

# "You would think that for the possessive form of '{b}it{/b}' you would add an apostrophe, making it '{b}it’s{/b},' right?" 
= 

# "Normally this would be correct, but in this case the possessive form of '{b}it{/b}' is simply '{b}its{/b}.'" 
= 

# "This is because '{b}it’s{/b}' is reserved for the contracted form of '{b}it is{/b}.'" 
= 

# "If you're wondering, a contraction is simply a shortened version of a word or words, with an apostrophe indicating where letters have been left out to make the contraction."

=

=
