=

=

= 

# "We're huddled even closer together than before."
=

=

=

=

=

=

=

= 

# "Hey, Yuri..."
= 

# "This might be a silly thought, but..."
=

= 

# "You...think so?"
= 

# "How does she?"
= 

# "Well, I guess she's more blunt in a lot of ways..."
=

=

= 

# "It's not like I can see into your head or anything..."
=

= 

# "I-I see..."
=

= 

# "But [player]..."
= 

# "That's probably..."
=

=

= 

# "W-Wait!"
= 

# "I didn't mean it in a bad way or anything!"
=

=

= 

# "A-Ah--"
=

=

=

=

=

=

= 

# "Ah..."
=

=

= 

# "You look kind of down..."
=

= 

# "Ah, it's not..."
=

= 

# "Yuri releases her hand from the book, causing it to close on top of my thumb."
=

=

=

= 

# "Um...!"
=

= 

# "Hmm..."
= 

# "In that case, I'll read a little more tonight."
= 

# "It'll be more fun to read with you after it picks up a bit, you know?"
= 

# "That's good reasoning."
= 

# "In that case, feel free to finish the first two chapters in your own time."
= 

# "Alright!"
= 

# "I stand up."
= 

# "I make a mental note of where I left off in the book, then slip it back into my bag."
=

= 

# "Eh?"
=

=

=

=

=

=

= 

# "Yes, let's!"
= 

# "Actually, I have a request..."
= 

# "...Do you mind if I make some tea first?"
= 

# "Not at all."
= 

# "Thanks very much."
= 

# "If there's one thing that can make my reading time here any better, it's a nice cup of tea."
= 

# "Not to mention for yourself, as well."
= 

# "Yuri stands up and makes her way to the closet."
= 

# "I follow and watch as she retrieves a small water pitcher from the shelf - the kind with a filter inside."
= 

# "Can you hold this for a second?"
= 

# "Sure..."
= 

# "Yuri hands me the water pitcher and also fetches an electric kettle."
= 

# "I'm going to plug this in at the teacher's desk, and then we'll go get some water."
= 

# "She walks past me and sets the kettle down on the teacher's desk."
= 

# "I simply watch her movements."
= 

# "To my surprise, the way she moves really contrasts her speaking mannerisms."
= 

# "Especially because of her long legs, Yuri appears elegant and methodical."
= 

# "Okay, may I have the water pitcher?"
= 

# "Thanks. I'll be right back."
= 

# "Ah, I might as well walk with you..."
= 

# "Yeah...why not?"
= 

# "Shall we go, then?"
= 

# "Yeah..."
= 

# "Hm? Where are you two off to?"
= 

# "Eh?"
= 

# "We're just...Yuri was going to make some tea, so..."
= 

# "I suddenly realize how weird it sounds to explain this to Monika."
= 

# "We're just filling the water pitcher..."
= 

# "Ah, okay!"
= 

# "Sorry, I was just a bit curious..."
= 

# "That's kind of a one-person job, isn't it?"
= 

# "That's--"
= 

# "Monika, please mind your own business for once."
= 

# "Or do you want to tell me there's something wrong with helping involve [player] in club activities?"
= 

# "E-Eh...?"
= 

# "My mouth gapes."
= 

# "I..."
= 

# "I suppose there's nothing wrong with that..."
= 

# "Hmph..."
= 

# "Then let's go, [player]."
= 

# "Ah..."
= 

# "Yuri quickly exits the room, and I follow."
= 

# "Once in the hallway, she suddenly puts her forehead against the wall."
= 

# "I spoke without thinking..."
= 

# "How could I say something like that...?"
= 

# "Yuri..."
= 

# "I just..."
= 

# "Something about the way she said that..."
= 

# "It made me feel so...irritated."
= 

# "What's wrong with me...?"
= 

# "No, Yuri."
= 

# "I think...you did the right thing!"
= 

# "I wasn't expecting it, but..."
= 

# "It's also not right for Monika to judge people like that."
= 

# "[player]..."
= 

# "How come even when I do something bad..."
= 

# "You're being nice to me?"
= 

# "Because."
= 

# "Nothing that you do is as bad as you make it seem in your head."
= 

# "Nobody's perfect."
= 

# "We have emotions, and we can't always hide them away."
= 

# "But you always amplify things in your head..."
= 

# "Your mind turns a light rain shower into a hurricane."
= 

# "Ah..."
= 

# "N-No..."
= 

# "Wouldn't you hate me for something as terrible as that...?"
= 

# "Why would I hate you?"
= 

# "I can't hate someone for having emotions..."
= 

# "What kind of friend would do that?"
= 

# "Friend...you say?"
= 

# "Ah...um..."
= 

# "Yuri lifts her head."
= 

# "[player]..."
= 

# "I really like...being friends with you!"
= 

# "Ahaha..."
= 

# "Thanks, Yuri."
= 

# "I like being friends with you too..."
= 

# "I feel kind of awkward saying something like that..."
= 

# "But I'm doing my best to help Yuri feel better."
= 

# "Anyway...!"
= 

# "Ah-- Yeah..."
= 

# "Shall we go?"
= 

# "Yeah."
= 

# "Yuri and I walk to the nearest water fountain."
= 

# "Once we fill up the water pitcher, we return to the classroom."
= 

# "Ah, yeah."
= 

# "Anything is fine."
= 

# "Very well."
= 

# "Now it's time to get the teapot."
= 

# "You really do this properly, don't you?"
= 

# "Of course..."
= 

# "I shouldn't do any less when I'm making tea for others."
= 

# "Even if I'm not an expert on tea or anything...?"
= 

# "Huhu."
= 

# "In that case, you'll only be even more impressed."
= 

# "Ah...perhaps I will!"
= 

# "Yuri fetches the teapot and begins measuring the tea leaves."
= 

# "To my surprise, she even starts humming a little to herself."
= 

# "You must be in a good mood now..."
= 

# "Is that so?"
= 

# "I was letting it show..."
= 

# "And you noticed."
= 

# "I was doing a bit of thinking..."
= 

# "And I decided that I would try expressing myself a little bit more."
= 

# "It turns out it's not very hard for me to do..."
= 

# "When it's you who's around, anyway."
= 

# "Ah..."
= 

# "That's great, Yuri!"
= 

# "Just don't push yourself too much."
= 

# "You're always worrying about me, [player]..."
= 

# "It's very endearing."
= 

# "That's..."
= 

# "Yuri wasn't kidding..."
= 

# "I don't even know if I can keep up with this...!"
= 

# "I watch Yuri pour a cup of tea for each of us."
= 

# "[player], I have another request."
= 

# "Do you mind if we sit on the floor today?"
= 

# "Eh? Why's that?"
= 

# "It's a little bit easier on my back..."
= 

# "I can read with my back against the wall rather than bending over at my desk."
= 

# "Ah, sorry, I didn't realize."
= 

# "No worries."
= 

# "I just have back pain fairly regularly, so I do my best to manage it."
= 

# "Is that so?"
= 

# "I wonder why that is..."
= 

# "It's most likely because my--"
= 

# "Ah--"
= 

# "M-My..."
= 

# "Your posture, right?"
= 

# "Always hunched over like that while reading..."
= 

# "Yes!"
= 

# "I have terrible reading posture!"
= 

# "So that's why we should sit on the floor."
= 

# "Fair enough."
= 

# "I'll go ahead and get the book."
= 

# "I retrieve the book from my bag."
= 

# "Ah, I have some chocolate as well..."
= 

# "It's a bag of small chocolate candies that I kept hidden from Sayori's candy radar."
= 

# "I take it, since it'll go well with the tea."
= 

# "Yuri and I then sit against the wall, teacups at our sides."
= 

# "As if in sync, we assume the same reading position as last time, each holding one half of the book."
= 

# "Except this time..."
= 

# "Our bodies are even closer to each other."
= 

# "I can't see too well..."
= 

# "Yuri slides closer until our shoulders are touching."
= 

# "How am I supposed to focus on reading like this...?!"
= 

# "Yuri was always kind of cute, but..."
= 

# "When she's being less apprehensive, it's almost more than I can handle!"
= 

# "Your teacup..."
= 

# "Yuri hands me my teacup."
= 

# "Holding it with my hand that's not holding the book, I end up in a position that makes it even harder to focus."
= 

# "Because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her chest...!"
= 

# "Meanwhile, Yuri hasn't noticed a single thing."
= 

# "She wears her intense reading expression, and I can only presume the world around her has faded away."
= 

# "I use all of my willpower to focus on reading."
= 

# "..."
= 

# "After a few minutes, I finally manage to relax a little."
= 

# "I put the teacup between my legs and fumble with the chocolate wrapper."
= 

# "Ah, sorry..."
= 

# "I briefly let go of the book to finish opening the wrapper."
= 

# "You can have as much as you want."
= 

# "Ah, that's..."
= 

# "That's okay, I won't take any..."
= 

# "Eh? Are you sure?"
= 

# "Well..."
=

= 

# "Ah, you're right..."
=

=

=

=

= 

# "Are you sure...?"
=

=

=

=

= 

# "Well, in that case..."
= 

# "Yuri is already totally focused on reading again."
= 

# "I take a chocolate candy and pop it into my mouth."
=

= 

# "And I hold it up to Yuri."
= 

# "She doesn't even look away from the book."
=

=

=

=
