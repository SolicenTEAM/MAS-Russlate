=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

= 

# "Okay, may I have the water pitcher?"
= 

# "Thanks. I'll be right back."
= 

# "Ah, I might as well walk with you..."
= 

# "T-That's okay!"
= 

# "You stay here..."
= 

# "It won't take long."
=

=

=

=

=

= 

# "..."
=

= 

# "Yuri said it wouldn't take long..."
=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

=

= 

# "Very well."
= 

# "Now it's time to get the teapot."
= 

# "You really do this properly, don't you?"
=

=

=

=

= 

# "In that case, you'll only be even more impressed."
= 

# "Ah...perhaps I will!"
=

= 

# "To my surprise, she even starts humming a little to herself."
= 

# "You must be in a good mood now..."
= 

# "Is that so?"
= 

# "I was letting it show..."
= 

# "And you noticed."
= 

# "I was doing a bit of thinking..."
= 

# "And I decided that I would try expressing myself a little bit more."
= 

# "It turns out it's not very hard for me to do..."
= 

# "When it's you who's around, anyway."
= 

# "Ah..."
= 

# "That's great, Yuri!"
= 

# "Just don't push yourself too much."
=

=

=

= 

# "Yuri wasn't kidding..."

= 

# "[player], I have another request."
= 

# "Do you mind if we sit on the floor today?"
= 

# "Eh? Why's that?"
= 

# "It's a little bit easier on my back..."
= 

# "I can read with my back against the wall rather than bending over at my desk."
= 

# "Ah, sorry, I didn't realize."
= 

# "No worries."
= 

# "I just have back pain fairly regularly, so I do my best to manage it."
= 

# "Is that so?"
= 

# "I wonder why that is..."
= 

# "It's most likely because my--"
= 

# "Ah--"
= 

# "M-My..."
= 

# "Your posture, right?"
= 

# "Always hunched over like that while reading..."
= 

# "Yes!"
= 

# "I have terrible reading posture!"
= 

# "So that's why we should sit on the floor."
= 

# "Fair enough."
= 

# "I'll go ahead and get the book."
= 

# "I retrieve the book from my bag."
= 

# "Ah, I have some chocolate as well..."
= 

# "It's a bag of small chocolate candies."
= 

# "I take it, since it'll go well with the tea."
= 

# "Yuri and I then sit against the wall, teacups at our sides."
= 

# "As if in sync, we assume the same reading position as last time, each holding one half of the book."
= 

# "Except this time..."
= 

# "Our bodies are even closer to each other."
= 

# "I can't see too well..."
= 

# "Yuri slides closer until our shoulders are touching."
= 

# "How am I supposed to focus on reading like this...?!"
= 

# "Yuri was always kind of cute, but..."
= 

# "When she's being less apprehensive, it's almost more than I can handle!"
= 

# "Your teacup..."
= 

# "Yuri hands me my teacup."
= 

# "Holding it with my hand that's not holding the book, I end up in a position that makes it even harder to focus."
= 

# "Because now I need to worry about making sure I don't accidentally touch her chest...!"
= 

# "Meanwhile, Yuri hasn't noticed a single thing."
= 

# "She wears her intense reading expression, and I can only presume the world around her has faded away."
= 

# "I use all of my willpower to focus on reading."
= 

# "..."
= 

# "After a few minutes, I finally manage to relax a little."
= 

# "I put the teacup between my legs and fumble with the chocolate wrapper."
= 

# "Ah, sorry..."
=

=

= 

# "Ah, that's..."
= 

# "That's okay, I won't take any..."
=

= 

# "Well..."
=

= 

# "Ah, you're right..."
=

= 

# "My bad..."
= 

# "No need to apologize."
= 

# "I'll hold the book, okay?"
= 

# "Are you sure...?"
= 

# "Of course."
= 

# "Yuri opens the book with both hands."
= 

# "She holds it so that I don't have any harder of a time reading from it."
= 

# "But as a result, her left arm is practically resting on top of my leg."
= 

# "Well, in that case..."
= 

# "Yuri is already totally focused on reading again."
= 

# "I take a chocolate candy and pop it into my mouth."
= 

# "Then, I take another chocolate..."
= 

# "And I hold it up to Yuri."
= 

# "She doesn't even look away from the book."
=

= 

# "But that means I can't stop here!"
=

=
